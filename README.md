# JDBC_TASK_2

## This project fetches and displays all student records from an Oracle 10g database using JDBC. 
This is a basic Java project created to test database connectivity between a Java application and an Oracle 10g database using JDBC.
The program loads the Oracle JDBC driver, establishes a connection, and prints "Connection Successful!" when everything works correctly.
## Objective
Load Oracle JDBC driver
Connect Java to Oracle 10g using JDBC
Print a success message
Handle exceptions and close the connection
## Technologies Used
